# üîß Fix the "Setup Required" Error

You're seeing this error because the SQL functions haven't been deployed to your Supabase database yet.

## ‚úÖ Solution (3 Steps - Takes 2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Test the Functions

Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
node test-supabase-functions.js
```

**What you'll see:**
- ‚úÖ If all pass ‚Üí Functions are deployed, skip to Step 3
- ‚ùå If all fail ‚Üí Functions are NOT deployed, continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Deploy the Functions to Supabase

1. **Open the SQL file:**
   - Open this file: `COPY_THIS_TO_SUPABASE.sql`
   - Press `Ctrl+A` to select all

3. **Paste and Run:**
   - Press `Ctrl+V` to paste
   - Click **"Run"** button (or press `Ctrl+Enter`)
   - Wait 5-10 seconds

4. **Verify Success:**
   You should see at the bottom:
   ```
   SUCCESS! Function created: get_store_comparison_metrics
   SUCCESS! Function created: get_store_health_indicators
   SUCCESS! Function created: get_store_performance_trends
   SUCCESS! Function created: get_store_rankings
   Total functions created: 4
   ```

## ‚ùì Still Not Working?

### Check #1: Are you using the correct Supabase project?

In Supabase dashboard, verify the project name matches your app.

### Check #2: Do your tables exist?

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('stores', 'tryon_history', 'credit_transactions');
```

You should see all 3 tables. If not, your database schema isn't set up yet.

### Check #3: Are you logged in as super_admin?

The store comparison page requires super_admin role. Regular users and store_admin cannot access it.

### Check #4: Environment variables

Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```
