# Store Comparison Analytics - Super Admin Feature

## Overview

The Store Comparison Analytics feature provides super admins with comprehensive insights into store performance across the entire platform. This enables data-driven decision-making, identification of high-performing stores, and early detection of struggling stores.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Functions (SQL)

Located in: `supabase/platform_analytics.sql`

#### New SQL Functions:

**a) `get_store_comparison_metrics(start_date, end_date)`**
- Returns comprehensive metrics for all stores including:
  - Store information (name, slug, active status)
  - Usage metrics (try-ons, unique users, active days)
  - Financial metrics (credits used, purchased, refunded)
  - Efficiency metrics (avg try-ons per user, avg credits per try-on)
  - Popular items per store
  - Peak usage hours
  - Activity timeline (first/last try-on dates)

**b) `get_store_performance_trends(start_date, end_date, store_id)`**
- Provides daily breakdown of store performance
- Can filter by specific store or view all stores
- Returns: date, store, try-ons, credits, unique users

**c) `get_store_rankings(start_date, end_date, metric)`**
- Ranks stores by different metrics:
  - `'tryons'` - Total try-on count
  - `'users'` - Unique user count
  - `'credits'` - Total credits used
  - `'efficiency'` - Average try-ons per user
- Returns ranking position and metric values

**d) `get_store_health_indicators(days_back)`**
- Calculates store health scores (0-100)
- Tracks trend direction (up, down, stable, inactive)
- Compares current vs previous period performance
- Shows growth percentages
- Identifies days since last activity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue: "Failed to fetch store comparison metrics"**
- **Cause:** SQL function not installed
- **Fix:** Run platform_analytics.sql migration

**Issue: "Not authenticated" error**
- **Cause:** Not logged in or session expired
- **Fix:** Log in as super_admin

**Issue: No data showing**
- **Cause:** No try-on history in selected date range
- **Fix:** Adjust date range or check if stores have activity

**Issue: Health scores all showing 0**
- **Cause:** Inactive stores or no recent activity
- **Fix:** Check store active status and recent try-ons

**Issue: Slow loading**
- **Cause:** Large date range with lots of data
- **Fix:** Use shorter date ranges or optimize database indexes

## Conclusion

The Store Comparison Analytics feature provides super admins with powerful insights into platform-wide performance. With health indicators, rankings, and detailed metrics, super admins can:

- Identify and support struggling stores
