# Analytics Is Working!

## Current Status

✅ **Analytics schema applied** - All views and functions exist
✅ **Try-on working** - Authentication fixed with `credentials: 'include'`
✅ **Data being recorded** - 26 try-ons already in database

## How Analytics Works

When you perform a virtual try-on:

1. **Try-on Request** → `/api/tryon`
2. **Credit Deduction** → `deduct_credits()` function is called
3. **Data Recording** → Two tables updated:
   - `credit_transactions` - Records credit usage
   - `tryon_history` - Records the try-on event ✅
4. **Analytics Views** → Auto-update from `tryon_history` data

## Verify Analytics Data

### Option 1: Check in Analytics Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/store/admin/analytics`
2. Select time period (30d, 7d, etc.)
3. View tabs:
   - **Overview** - Main metrics and trends
   - **Insights** - Peak hours, weekly patterns
   - **Users & Activity** - Top users, recent activity

### Option 2: Check via API (while logged in)
```bash
# Get store analytics overview
curl http://localhost:3000/api/store/analytics

# Get advanced analytics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/store/analytics/advanced?period=30d&groupBy=day
```

### Option 3: Check Database Directly
In Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check try-on history count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tryon_history;

-- Check recent try-ons
SELECT * FROM tryon_history ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check analytics overview
SELECT * FROM analytics_store_overview;
```

## Current Data (as of last check)

From `analytics_store_overview`:
- **Total Try-Ons:** 26
- **Total Credits Used:** 26
- **Try-Ons Last 7 Days:** 26
- **Try-Ons Last 30 Days:** 26
- **Clothing Images:** 2
- **Total Users:** 2

## If Analytics Dashboard Shows "No Data"

This might be due to:

### 1. **Cache/Refresh Issue**
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors

### 2. **Time Period Filter**
- The try-ons might be outside the selected time period
- Try selecting "All Time" in the period dropdown

### 3. **RLS Permissions**
The analytics views respect Row Level Security (RLS). Make sure you're logged in as:
- `store_admin` - Can see their store's analytics
- `super_admin` - Can see all analytics

### 4. **Check API Response**
Open browser DevTools → Network tab → Look for `/api/store/analytics/advanced` request:
- Should return 200 status
- Check the response JSON for `metrics.totalTryOns` value

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify you're logged in as store admin**
   ```
   Go to: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/me
   Check: role should be "store_admin" or "super_admin"
   ```

2. **Check if data exists for your store**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   SELECT * FROM tryon_history
   WHERE store_id = 'your-store-id'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

3. **Verify analytics API returns data**
   ```
   Open: http://localhost:3000/api/store/analytics
   (Must be logged in)
   Should show: totalTryOns, totalCreditsUsed, etc.
   ```

4. **Do a fresh try-on and check immediately**
   - Perform a new virtual try-on
   - Immediately go to analytics page
   - Select "All Time" period
   - Data should appear instantly

## Why Data Might Show in Database But Not Dashboard

1. **React State Not Updating** - The dashboard fetches data on mount and when period changes
2. **Wrong Store Context** - Make sure you're viewing analytics for the correct store
3. **API Endpoint Error** - Check browser console for fetch errors
4. **RLS Blocking** - Store admins can only see their own store's data

## Force Analytics Refresh

On the analytics page:
1. Click the **Refresh button** (circular arrow icon in top right)
2. Or change the time period dropdown
3. Or hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)

## Success Indicators

✅ `/api/debug/analytics` shows: `"schema_applied": true`
✅ `analytics_store_overview.total_tryons` > 0
✅ `tryon_history` table has records
✅ Try-on completes successfully without errors
✅ Credits decrease after each try-on

Your analytics **IS** working and recording data! If the dashboard doesn't show it, it's a display/refresh issue, not a data issue.
